Run the train_dating function
* example: train_dating(100,30,10,20,.001)
* here 100 = number of Iterations
	30 = dimension of a tarining example ( number of features).
	10 =  number of negative weights
	20 = number of training example
	.001 = Regularization parameter.
	it returns a matrix contaning dot products  ( for 20 more examples) for each iteration.
